After trying out a few free courses and also crafted my own learning path, I decided to take on the paid &lt;em>Udacity Data Engineering Nanodegree&lt;/em> last September just to know if it has anything better than the free resources. Although I don&amp;rsquo;t think this program is a waste of time, I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely convinced that it worths every penny.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
