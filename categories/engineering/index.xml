&lt;p>As someone transitioning from an analyst to a data engineering role, I struggled to find a standardized road map to follow, since there were so many resources to learn from, and it was very easy to get lost. After trying out a few free courses and also crafted my own learning path, I decided to take on the paid &lt;em>Udacity Data Engineering Nanodegree&lt;/em> last September just to know if it has anything better than the free resources. Although I don&amp;rsquo;t think this program is a waste of time, I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely convinced that it worths every penny.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to run dbt CI with GitHub Action</title><link>http://hoanghapham.github.io/posts/dbt-ci-with-github-actions/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Nov 2021 12:39:24 +0700</pubDate><guid>http://hoanghapham.github.io/posts/dbt-ci-with-github-actions/</guid><description>&lt;p>If you are familiar with the modern data stack, probably &lt;strong>dbt&lt;/strong> is no stranger. dbt tries to bring the best practices from the software engineering world into data development, and one of such practices is the idea of automated testing and continuous integration (CI).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While dbt Cloud provides a &amp;ldquo;slim CI&amp;rdquo; feature that satisfies most basic needs, you will have more control over your CI jobs if you make use of your git provider&amp;rsquo;s CI/CD functions. In this project, we will look at how to create a dbt CI job using GitHub Actions&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
