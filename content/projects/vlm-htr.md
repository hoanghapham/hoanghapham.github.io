In this project, I fine-tuned Visual Language Models (VLMs) and create an end-to-end pipeline for  Handwrittent Text Recognitition tasks on historical Swedish manuscripts. The VLM-based pipeline is also compared against the classical YOLO - TrOCR pipeline.

The project was done in collaboration with the Swedish National Archives (Riksarkivet).

- **Models:** Florence-2, YOLO, TrOCR
- **Tools:** PyTorch, transformers, Gradio
