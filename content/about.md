I'm an aspiring **Machine Learning Engineer / AI Engineer** with 5+ years of industry experience in data analytics. 

Recently completed my Master's degree in Language Technology at Uppsala University, I'm looking for opportunities to improve my skills in machine learning, NLP, and AI engineering.

Aside from coding, I enjoy reading, writing, gaming, movie-going, and playing music. 

Ted Chiang's ["Stories of Your Life"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/223380.Stories_of_Your_Life_and_Others) is my all-time favorite sci-fi story.
